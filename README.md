# Mobile HTTP Module for Angular
This module will help to switch between `Cordova` & `XHR`. For now this module is created to work with `@angular/http`.

## Usage
Below variable need to switch to `true` / `false` to toggle use between `Cordova` & `XHR` usage.

### To switch to use Browser XHR
```javascript
var isMobile = false;
```

### To switch to use Cordova HTTP
```javascript
var isMobile = true;
```

### Angular Integration
Just use `MobileHttpModule` in your module files. Rest of the application (Components / Services) will continue using `Http` from `@angular/http`.
```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule, MobileHttpModule],
  declarations: [AppComponent, HelloComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```
